# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard**

## **Project Description**

The RBAC dashboard includes the following features:
- **User Authentication**: Login functionality with predefined users and their roles.
- **Role Management**: Add, edit, view, and delete roles with specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete).
- **User Management**: Add, edit, view, and delete users and assign roles dynamically.
- **Permission Control**: Users are restricted to actions based on their assigned roles and permissions.
